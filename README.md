# ‚öôÔ∏è Developing / Building yourself
## Requirements
* Python 3 (Recommended: Python 3.9)
* PIP

## How it works
After the presentator has pressed one of the two buttons on his device, a webhook request is sent to the client with the session ID via our server. Depending on whether the presentation is to be moved forwards or backwards, the client emulates the push of the corresponding arrow key.
